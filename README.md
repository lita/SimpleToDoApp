### Extended Features
* Custom ArrayAdapater, with a check-box and a due date.
* Custom Dialogs for editing the task and due date rather than launching a new activity.
* Made it so that the item and the date were selectable separately within the same row.
* Made the check box and the date persist, no matter what you were editing.

### Required Features
* Able to add to-do items
* Able to remove to-do items with a long click (pressing on the item for 2 seconds)
* Able to edit to-do items by clicking on the item.
    * The edit page focuses on the edit text box.
    * Old value is propagated into the edit text box and the cursor starts at the end.
* Will persist the data entered into the app.
* When a user enters an empty item, we don't add it to the list.
* When a user enters an empty string in edit mode, that item gets deleted.
